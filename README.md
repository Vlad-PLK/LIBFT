  LIBFT
</p>

Here you can find the very first project of 42's common core named LIBFT.
The goal is to create a library composed of various C functions.
Throught this project I acquired a lot of C basic skills and knowledge that I will use even more in my future more complex subjects. 
This library is a really strong fondation for every C programmer and here I will go through some crucial concepts that I have learned.
